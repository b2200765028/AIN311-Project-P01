"Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.",In what decade did machine learning dominate the field?,the first decades of the 21st century

"Throughout its history, the United States has been a nation of immigrants. The population is diverse with people from all over the world seeking refuge and a better way of life.

The six regions of the United States are New England, the mid-Atlantic, the South, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the West.

The New England states, namely Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, became home to European settlers who came in search of religious freedom.

The mid-Atlantic region includes the city of Washington, D.C., Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania. Because the mid-Atlantic region consisted largely of industrial areas, it attracted millions of European immigrants. As a result, the mid-Atlantic gave rise to some of the largest East Coast cities, such as New York, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.

The Southern states, namely Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, were all states which struggled after the Civil War. The Civil War, one of the most important chapters in U.S history, was fought between 1861 and s1865.

The Midwest is called the nation's breadbasket, because it is home to the country's agricultural base. The Midwest comprises the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

The Southwest is a beautiful stark landscape of prairie and desert, which includes the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Southwest is home to some of the world's great natural marvels, including the Grand Canyon and Carlsbad Caverns.

The American West is a symbol of the pioneering spirit of the United States, and is the home of rolling plains and the cowboy. The Western states, including Alaska, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming make up a diverse landscape. The western landscape ranges from endless wilderness to barren desert, coral reefs to Arctic tundra, Hollywood to Yellowstone.",How many states are in the United States of America?,50

"Elon Musk has shown again he can influence the digital currency market with just his tweets. After saying that his electric vehicle-making company Tesla will not accept payments in Bitcoin because of environmental concerns, he tweeted that he was working with developers of Dogecoin to improve system transaction efficiency.

In a recent tweet, Musk put out a statement from Tesla that it was concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin (price in India) mining and transaction, and hence was suspending vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency.  

A day later he again tweeted saying, To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can't drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal. It triggered a downward spiral for Bitcoin value but the cryptocurrency has stabilised since.  A number of Twitter users welcomed Musk's statement.

While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was herself.",Mary had to make a decision that would upset someone. What was the decision about?,A decision with no clear solution that would please everyone
"Either you are a child or an old aged person, science is for everyone and helpful in every stage. Science has made our life easier. If you do not want to walk, there is a bike or car for you.

"In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply.

For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.

The man who invented a solution to this problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in the field of photography and held over 70 patents by the end of his career. His story of creativity and innovation, which I will share now, is a useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative process.",What problem did newspapers and printers face in the 1870s?,Printing images quickly and cheaply

"Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York. After two years of learning the ins and outs of the printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby Cornell University. He spent the rest of the decade experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about cameras, printers, and optics.

In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing technique.

“While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw before me, apparently projected on the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”

Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained the standard printing technique for the next 80 years.",How did Ives start his career?,As a printer's apprentice

"In 1940, an advertising executive named James Webb Young published a short guide titled, A Technique for Producing Ideas. In this guide, he made a simple, but profound statement about generating creative ideas.

According to Young, innovative ideas happen when you develop new combinations of old elements. In other words, creative thinking is not about generating something new from a blank slate, but rather about taking what is already present and combining those bits and pieces in a way that has not been done previously.

Most important, the ability to generate new combinations hinges upon your ability to see the relationships between concepts. If you can form a new link between two old ideas, you have done something creative.","According to James Webb Young, what is the process of generating creative ideas?",Developing new combinations of old elements
"I write frequently about how mastery requires consistency. That includes ideas like putting in your reps, improving your average speed, and falling in love with boredom. These ideas are critical, but The Helsinki Bus Station Theory helps to clarify and distinguish some important details that often get overlooked.

Does consistency lead to success?

Consider a college student. They have likely spent more than 10,000 hours in a classroom by this point in their life. Are they an expert at learning every piece of information thrown at them? Not at all. Most of what we hear in class is forgotten shortly thereafter.
Consider someone who works on a computer each day at work. If you’ve been in your job for years, it is very likely that you have spent more than 10,000 hours writing and responding to emails. Given all of this writing, do you have the skills to write the next great novel? Probably not.
Consider the average person who goes to the gym each week. Many folks have been doing this for years or even decades. Are they built like elite athletes? Do they possess elite level strength? Unlikely.
The key feature of The Helsinki Bus Station Theory is that it urges you to not simply do more work, but to do more re-work.","Does 10,000 hours of classroom time guarantee success?",No

The man leads towards cruelty without the presence of Love. The society treats him with inferiority and disrespect. Individuals don’t like to talk with him and get in touch with him when they have some urgent work. Everything is possible with the assistance of love; that is why the creatures understand the unique language of affection.

"The environment is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive. The French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround,’ is derived from the English word ‘environment.’ It is made up of living creatures like plants, animals, and human beings. The non-living elements of the environment are air, water, and land. Nature has designed its functioning in such a way that everything is interdependent. The human beings are the most powerful of all the creatures that rely on and make use of the earth’s natural resources. Air is required for the survival of not just humans, but also plants and animals. Without air, there will be no life on Earth. Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, make up the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earth’s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings. The environment is influenced by a variety of elements; of which some are natural, and others are man-made.",What is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive?,The environment

Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, make up the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earth’s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings.

"The simple substance ethylene is a gas composed of molecules with the formula CH2CH2. Under certain conditions, many ethylene molecules will join together to form a long chain called polyethylene, with the formula (CH2CH2)n, where n is a variable but large number. Polyethylene is a tough, durable solid material quite different from ethylene. It is an example of a polymer, which is a large molecule made up of many smaller molecules (monomers), usually joined together in a linear fashion. Many naturally occurring substances, including cellulose, starch, cotton, wool, rubber, leather, proteins, and DNA, are polymers. Polyethylene, nylon, and acrylics are examples of synthetic polymers. The study of such materials lies within the domain of polymer chemistry, a specialty that has flourished in the 20th century.

"Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering and even sports.

Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and math has been used by even the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose because of the increasingly complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced mathematical solutions, as outlined by mathematician Raymond L. Wilder in his book ""Evolution of Mathematical Concepts(opens in new tab)"" (Dover Publications, 2013). 

The more complex a society, the more complex the mathematical needs. Primitive tribes needed little more than the ability to count, but also used math to calculate the position of the sun and the physics of hunting. ""All the records — anthropological and historical — show that counting and, ultimately, numeral systems as a device for counting form the inception of the mathematical element in all cultures,"" Wilder wrote in 1968.","What is the name of the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement?",mathematical

"Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering and even sports.

Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and math has been used by even the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose because of the increasingly complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced mathematical solutions, as outlined by mathematician Raymond L.

"How human beings converse with each other is by using a common language. It is a body of words for their use common to people of the same community or nation, the same geographical area, or the same cultural tradition. The methodological study of language is called linguistics. The language distinguishes a country or in a region or a community.

Human language has the properties of capacity and movement and relies entirely on social convocation and learning. The Language was originated when preceding hominids gradually started changing their hominoid communication systems, acquiring the ability to approach other minds and lived experience.

"The Cold War is a term commonly used to refer to a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The term cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945. Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.",When did nazi Germany and imperial japan defeat?,in 1945
